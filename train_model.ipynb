    "# Traveling Salesman Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The traveling salesman problem requires finding the optimal route to be taken by a \"traveling salesman\" as they visit a set of cities.  The distances between cities are given, and the goal is to find the minimum distance to be traveled if we want to visit all the cities and return to the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this falls in the category of NP-hard problems: in other words, there is no known polynomial time algorithm that will give the minimum distance to be traveled - any solution to this problem more or less requires enumerating all permutations, which is more than exponential in the number of cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider a simplified version of the problem, where cities are specified by their (x, y) coordinates, and the distance between cities is assumed to be the Euclidean distance.  This is unrealistic in practice since cities are normally connected by roads, and not all cities may be connected to all other cities, but this simple problem helps to illustrate one approach to solving such problems using Simulated Annealing."

You could also decide to continue until there is no improvement in the solution for some number of iterations, or the cost goes below a certain threshold, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration, a new neighbour is generated.  The cost of this is calculated, and the decision to *accept* or *reject* the new solution is based on either actual improvement, or a *coin toss* - a random event whose probability decreases with iterations.  Eventually, the chance of accepting poorer solutions is so low that we settle to a solution, which hopefully is a good solution given the method used for searching through the neighbourhood."
